# Traffic signs: The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Predicting the class of traffic signs based on a deep learning classifier.
Traffic sign classification for self-driving cars.

The CNN used here is known as LeNet (A convolutional neural network).

The dataset contains 43 different classes of signs.
